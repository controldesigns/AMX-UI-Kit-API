AMX-UI-Kit-API
==============
Control Designs Software Ltd

UI Kit provides an advanced function based means of controlling an AMX user interface. Now out of Beta, but being updated all the time, it lets an AMX programmer call things like button commands and page / popup commands easily using a library of calls. Documentation will improve as this library goes on.

Enjoy!
